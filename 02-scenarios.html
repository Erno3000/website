                <p>
                    Small daily tasks can sometimes create a lot of hassle. Crownstone enables you to run things more smoothly.
                    Use one on a lamp as a wake-up light to start your day, or as a night-light that subtly goes off when you go to bed.
                    And no more wondering if you turned off your curling iron or toaster: now you have the peace of
                    mind to know there are no devices left turned on or on stand-by if you're not at home.

                <p>
                    We all aim to make our house a safe place, especially if you have kids.
                    Crownstone enhances the safety of your home by acting as a child-lock. Kids are curious,
                    and though we would love to, we aren't always able to keep an eye on them. If your child is in the kitchen when you are in the
                    laundry room, you no longer have to worry about your child accidentally turning on a kitchen appliance:
                    Crownstone makes sure the appliances only work when you are in the room. If you're not in the room the power usage is cut off,
                    creating a safe environment for your young ones.

                <h1>Saving energy insight into usage</h1>
                <p>
                    With Crownstone you can get insight in your energy usage, by allowing you to monitor your power consumption
                    through your mobile device. Crownstone is also able to identify appliances based on their energy consumption. It recognizes your TV, your fridge, etc.
                    so it knows which appliances can or can't be turned off.
                    This means it can automatically turn off devices that don't need to be on stand-by, saving you energy and money.

                <p>
                    In this day and age, almost everyone owns a smartphone, a tablet and/or a laptop.
                    A lot of the devices we use on a day-to-day basis are equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
                    By allowing these devices to communicate and work together,
                    we can use this connection to support us in our daily lives.
                    Crownstone aims to simplify and enhance your life by using IoT to smarten up your home.

                    Even though your grandparents may not carry their smartphones around with them, Crownstones measure
                    power usage of all the devices they are connected to. By comparing the power usage patterns with those it has
                    learned are normal, you can be alerted when a major divergence from the normal usage is detected.

                    Crownstone empowers you to make your home reflect your mood, turn any light into a soothing sunrise in the morning and save energy while doing so!
