# VolkerWessels

At VolkerWessels Crownstones are integrated in their Internet of Things platform, called Yodiwo. This enables data
to come in about energy consumption, about the presence of people, and about the use of the building in general.
It is possible to use the Yodiwo platform to couple data with actions or to populate visualizations with data.

# Watchi

In formal care Crownstones can be used for positioning of elderly and sending an alarm to care professionals only
when someone leaves a particular zone. The elderly can wear the Watchi which already has similar functionality 
on the level of GPS outside of the care facilities.
