# Crownstone

The Crownstone infrastructure can be used in smart offices to:
* save energy
        - switch office equipment and lights off when nobody is around
* find colleagues
        - know if your colleague is working from home, in a meeting room, or where he or she is in the building
* personalize desks
        - respect personal preferences about lighting and climate
        
        
# Guidestone

The Guidestone is a simplified Crownstone which only uses presence and proximity. Its working title has been DoBeacon which reflects that it works as an iBeacon, but with more power and faster updating frequency and longer lifetime because it is a power plug. Download the [brochure]({{ basesite.url }}/attachments/DoBeaconBrochure.pdf) if you'd like to know more.
