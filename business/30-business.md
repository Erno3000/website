# Crownstone

The Crownstone infrastructure can be used in smart offices to:

* save energy

    * switch off office equipment (multi-functionals, coffee machines, televisions, electronic equipment) when nobody is around
    * switch off lights when nobody is around (and not when someone is still working!!)

* find people and places

    * know if your colleague is working from home, in a meeting room, or where he or she is in the building
    * find an unoccupied meeting room
    * find a desk

        
# Guidestone Lite

The Guidestone Lite is a simplified Crownstone (<a href="https://shop.crownstone.rocks/products/guidestones-light">shop</a>) that works as an iBeacon and comes with indoor localization capabilities alone (it is not a switch, dimmer, etc.). The benefits of the Guidestones above ordinary battery-based iBeacons:

* A short advertisement interval means frequent updates and thus faster localization.
* A high signal strength means more beacons visible through walls that are difficult to penetrate which increases localization accuracy.
* Indoor localization algorithms on the phone (there are a lot of parties that use only proximity to beacons for localization, this does not work, you need to use machine learning).

This product is that far simplified, that we have competitors (although they use USB beacons that require an additional adaptor). For a comparison, look at:

* Radbeacon's shop lists <a href="http://store.radiusnetworks.com/collections/all/products/radbeacon-usb-2">$29</a> plus <a href="http://store.radiusnetworks.com/collections/all/products/radbeacon-usb-power-supply">$ 9</a> for an adaptor.
* Kontakt's shop lists <a href="https://store.kontakt.io/our-products/29-usb-beacon.html">$ 60</a> without adaptor.
* Glimworm's shop lists <a href="https://glimwormbeacons.com/buy/ibeacons">â‚¬ 25 euro</a> without adaptor.

# Guidestone Mesh

The Guidestone Mesh comes with additional functionality, namely meshing and tracking:

* The Guidestones can be updated at all once from a central location because they are all inter-connected through a mesh.
* The Guidestones are able to scan for BLE (Bluetooth Low-Energy) devices. This means that they can scan for the presence of people carrying bracelets, watches, or any other deivce that sends out regular BLE messages. They can even track iBeacons!

The Guidestone Mesh can be reliably hooked up to the internet using special hubs.
