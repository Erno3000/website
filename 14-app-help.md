Dimming is already possible in the Crownstone firmware. However, to prevent you from accidently dimming the wrong devices we have not yet enabled it in the app. See our <a href="https://trello.com/b/6rUcIt62/crownstone-transparent-product-roadmap">roadmap</a> that lists when to expect which functionality and where you can vote to make sure the functionality you like most will increase in priority.

One basic concept the Crownstone app introduces is the **sphere**. A sphere is a loosely connected group of Crownstones, a little bit like a

a

or a 
<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460">list on Twitter</a>.
A very logical sphere is your home. Another logical sphere is your office. However, nothing prevents you from defining a sphere that is not confined to a single physical space. Access rights are defined on the level of a sphere. This makes it easy to give other people access to select groups of Crownstones that you own.

                                If you have four or more Crownstones in a single sphere, there will be an icon at the top-left that allows you to initiate teaching your home the rooms that are available. Each room gets a little sign that indicates that it can be taught. It is important not to place the Crownstones too far from each other. They have to be a maximum of 10-20 meters apart, preferably in adjacent rooms. Currently the indoor localization is disabled if in a room not enough Crownstones are visible. This is due to the fact that the current machine learning method cannot cope yet with seeing less Crownstones. The training itself is by walking around in the room when pressing a big round button in the interface. You can subsequently couple actions to the interface if you enable Beta functionality.
