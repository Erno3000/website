				<h2>Crownstone</h2>
				<p>
				DoBots offers an interesting component to a <strong>Smart Building</strong>, the crownstone, a Bluetooth Low-Energy switching block that can be embedded everywhere in a building. Not only can people use their smartphones to control every wire in the building, but also the building knows where the people are.

				<h2>Guidestone</h2>
				<p>
                If you're only interested in the localization functionality of the Crownstone, we have a solution exactly for that, the Guidestone. The Guidestone is an iBeacon/Eddystone product that can be plugged into a power outlet. This means that it doesn't need a battery. Thanks to the fact that the power comes directly from the power outlet, it can send according to Apple specifications (every 100ms) and with considerable strength. Compared to battery-based iBeacon products this means that the localization can be done with faster response times and higher accuracy.
