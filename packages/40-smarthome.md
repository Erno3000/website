## Customers

If you as a customer encounter prices that are lower than the ones mentioned, please pay attention to the following:

* Is the installer an actual professional and certified installer?
* Is the product they are using including 10 years warranty? Ask for proof in case of doubts.
* Will the system be completely configured by the installer or do they leave the configuration to you as a customer?
