# Technology
                
Crownstone uses your mere presence and proximity (indoor localization) to control lights and devices in the home or office environment. Crownstone brings a wide range of apps to the smart home. One of these apps disables dangerous devices when adults are not around bringing child safety to the next level. Crownstone provides indoor localization to [businesses](/business) on its hardware-as-a-platform.
                
What can the Crownstones do for you at home?
                
* It's a switch, a dimmer, a power monitor, and a standby killer at once. Only getting rid of standby power consumption saves an average household 10% on the electricity bill. That's already 70 euros each year! 
* It does not need you to fiddle around on a smartphone. You can switch on devices automatically by just entering the room with the smartphone in your pocket or at your ear! It's ultimate comfort!
* It's a smart child-lock. It is impossible for your kid to switch on a dangerous device like a blender, a grill, or an iron, if you're not right there.
* It's a wake-up light or a go-to-bed light. No need to buy fancy products for this. Your normal lights can wake you up in a friendly manner.
* It can be configured with a holiday setting to prevent burglary. The lighting will go on at the evening, as if you're at home. 
                
And you'll definitely have to check the [scenarios]({{ BASE_PATH }}/scenarios)!

# Kickstarter
				
The Crownstone is originally developed for a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dobots/crownstone) project. We were on many European news sites and in general this really kickstarted our business in many ways (being accepted in the Rockstart accelerator for example). Some of the features of the Crownstone you can watch in this Kickstarter promo.

On [our roadmap](https://trello.com/b/6rUcIt62/crownstone-transparent-product-roadmap) you will find more tasks that are planned already, from integration with Alexa to configuration of preconfigured scenes. A nice example of another company that brings a lot of firmware updates is Fujifilm. Look at [this list](https://petapixel.com/2017/03/22/fujifilm-x-t2x-pro2-firmware-update-bring-33-improvements/) of impressive updates that are so significant that it feels like you own a completely new camera! We will always have a few features under the radar that hopefully will make you feel the same!
