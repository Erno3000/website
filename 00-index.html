                <p>
                Crownstone's secret sauce is <b>indoor positioning</b>. The Crownstones know where you are if you carry a smart device with you. This can be a phone, a fitness wrist band, or a key tag. There is no need anymore to (1) get your phone, (2) unlock it, (3) open an app, (4) navigate to the right screen, and (5) click some button! Your smart home automatically reacts to you entering a room! 
                </p>
                <p>It turns on the lights for you when you enter with your hands full of groceries and two little kids. It switches off energy-hungry devices automatically without you having to think of it! It turns of an electric device if you forget! It wakes you up by switching on the lights in the bedroom. It makes sure your little kid cannot use the microwave or drill if you're not there! Finally! Now, because your home knows where you are, it can become smart for the first time in history!
                </p>
                <h2>Aren't you frustrated?</h2>
                <p>
                Isn't it true? Aren't you frustrated at times nowadays that with all this technology, so many things still don't work right?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We have to take care of the environment. However, up to 10% of our electricity bill goes to devices in stand-by mode. Do I really have to disconnect the mediabox all the time when I leave the house?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Grandma falls in the bathroom, but can't yell loud enough to reach the "alarm system" in the living room. Why doesn't her house know that she stays in the bathroom for too long!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Children playing grown-up in the kitchen. Isn't it ridiculous that nowadays the smartest way to protect our children is by cabinet locks, fences, and perhaps some safety covers on our outlets?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                There is no reason that this cannot be solved, and the key component is the same: knowing where someone is indoors!

                <h1>Crownstones use your position to help you out!</h1>
                <p>
                Crownstones pinpoint your position through the use of BLE (see <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/technology-consumer">technology page</a>). Crownstones can immediately start doing things for you because they are integrated in a power outlet or power plug. They can do anything a current smart plug does and more!
                A Crownstone is a switch, a dimmer, a presence detector, a power monitor, an AI, and an open platform, all in one!

                <h1>Crownstone Plug</h1>
                <p>
                The Crownstone plug (<a href="https://shop.crownstone.rocks/products/ready-to-go-kit-with-two-plug-in-crownstones">shop</a>) is plug-and-play! Just download the Crownstone app and any device that you plug into it can react to your presence. Use the Crownstone plug behind the Horizon television box if you want to save <abbr title="38W * 20 hour * 365 days * 22 cent/kWh = € 61 per year">€ 61 per year</abbr> (see <a href="https://radar.avrotros.nl/forum/viewtopic.php?t=163063">38 Watt in stand-by</a>). Plus, it won't be so slow when starting up from stand-by anymore! Or put a few of them behind your lights in the living room if you're tired of doing the rounds flipping ten switches each night! Or put one wherever your kids are always forgetting to switch off the light! 
                </p>
                <h2>Crownstone is social hardware: send a sweet message!</h2>
                <p>
                If you have four or more Crownstones they can start to pinpoint your location per room. Crownstones are self-learning. You walk a few rounds in the living room and then tell them that this is the living room. You do the same in the kitchen and the Crownstone AI learns automatically that that is the kitchen!</p>
                <p>You can also send messages to a specific location, pretty cool! Think of a sweet message to your loved one, e.g. "@mylove #kitchen I cooked you something tasty. Check the fridge!" or "@mylove <i class="el el-heart-empty"></i> #livingroom There is a great show on channel 4!" or "@mylove #bathroom Light a match, lol!"

                <p>
                If you are renovating your home or if you like to to have your home smart without having plugs in each power outlet, you can do this as well! The built-in Crownstone (<a href="https://shop.crownstone.rocks/products/built-in-crownstone">shop</a>) is thin and small and fits behind any power outlet. They have exactly the same functionality as the Crownstone plugs, and only need you to be a bit handy with wires (as is the case with ordinary Dutch "kroonsteentjes", electric connectors).
                </p>
                <h2>Smart Buildings</h2>
                <p>
